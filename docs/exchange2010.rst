    .. attribute:: text_body

      The text version of the message. Either this or :attr:`html_body` must be set.

    .. attribute:: body

    .. attribute:: organizer

      **Read-only.** The organizer of the event.

      This returns a :class:`ExchangeEventOrganizer` object.

    .. attribute:: attendees

      All attendees invited to this event.

      Iterating over this property yields a list of :class:`ExchangeEventResponse` objects::

          for person in event.attendees:
            print person.name, person.response


      You can set the attendee list by assigning to this property::

          event.attendees = [u'somebody@company.foo',
                             u'somebodyelse@company.foo']

      If you add attendees this way, they will be required for the event.

      To add optional attendees, either use :attr:`optional_attendees` or add people using the :class:`ExchangeEventAttendee` object::

          from pyexchange.base import ExchangeEventAttendee

          attendee = ExchangeEventAttendee(name="Jane Doe",
                                           email="jane@her.email",
                                           required=False)

          event.attendees = attendee

      Attendees must have an email address defined.

    .. attribute:: required_attendees

      Required attendees for this event. ::

          event.required_attendees = [u'important_person@company.foo',
                                      u'admin@company.foo']

          for person in event.required_attendees:
            print person.email

      This property otherwise behaves like :attr:`attendees`.

    .. attribute:: optional_attendees

      Optional attendees for this event. ::

          event.optional_attendees = [u'maybe@company.foo',
                                      u'other_optional@company.foo']

          for person in event.optional_attendees:
            print person.email

      This property otherwise behaves like :attr:`attendees`.

    .. attribute:: resources

          event.resources = [u'conferenceroom@company.foo']

          for room in event.resources:
            print room.email

      This property otherwise behaves like :attr:`attendees`.

    .. attribute:: conference_room

      **Read-only.** A property to return the first resource, since the most common use case is a meeting
      with one resource (the conference room). ::

          event.resources = [u'conferenceroom@company.foo']

      It should be a value between 1 and 999 for 'daily'.
      It should be a value between 1 and 99 for 'weekly' and 'monthly'.

    .. attribute:: recurrence_end_date

      Should be a datetime.date() object which specifies the end of the recurrence.

          event.add_attendee([u'chrissie@company.foo'])

          print len(event.attendees) # prints 3

      If *required* is true, attendees will be marked as required. Otherwise, they'll be optional.

    .. method:: remove_attendees(attendees)

      Removes attendees from the event. ::

          event.attendees = [u'jane@company.foo',

                             u'chrissie@company.foo']
          event.remove_attendees([u'jack@company.foo', u'chrissie@company.foo'])
